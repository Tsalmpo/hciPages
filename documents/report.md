## Prototyping
**Where and Why:** The prototyping was done on Figma, a widely used platform for designing and testing UI/UX due to its collaborative features and ease of use.

## Programming Language
**Choice:** The project uses React (with TypeScript). React was chosen for its robust component-based structure, reusability, and strong community support.

## Project's Structure
**Key Directories:**
- `src`: Contains the core application code.
- `app`: Likely for app-wide utilities or context.
- `assets`: Holds images or other static assets.
- `components`: Reusable components for the UI.
- `pages`: Different application pages.
- `index.tsx`: Entry point for the app.
- `public`: Static files and initial HTML template.
- `documents`: Additional documentation.
The project follows a modular structure, dividing responsibilities across components and pages.


## Components used
**Origin:** All components were built manually to maintain consistency with the design and application requirements.

## Key Functionalities
- Functionalities are implemented using React hooks and TypeScript for type safety.
- Key functionalities include routing (react-router-dom), modals (react-responsive-modal), and state management through React's context or hooks.

## Commands to start the Application
- Install dependencies: `npm i`
- Start the development server: `npm start`

## Notes
- The project is configured with Webpack for bundling and TypeScript for enhanced type checking.
- The team adhered to linting standards using ESLint.

## Conclusion
The application repository is hosted on GitHub: [Find our repository here.](https://github.com/dimitry-lzs/hciWeb)
