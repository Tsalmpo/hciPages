        - Add operability so when user selects a preset, dummy values for lighting, color, switching patterns, etc. are set.
    
    - For Energy Management Page:
        - Add operability when user turns on `Power-saving mode`. Air condition should be automatically turned off and and current energy consumption value should be dropped.
